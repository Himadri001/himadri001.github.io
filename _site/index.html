      <h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px;"> About Me</h2>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">I am a Computer Science graduate who used to be good at debating. I have completed my graduation from BRAC University, Bangladesh. From debating I first mastered logic building which later on laid the path to develop scalable and distributed solutions to address real-world problems. In my professional career, I have developed software solutions that provide transportation and logistics support for millions of users
<br /><br />
Apart from contributing to the industry, I have always sought to engage in research projects, particularly in the domains of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am currently working in MSiP (multi media singal image processing lab) supervised by Jia Uddin, PhD. My research area is Medical Image Processing and Deep Segmentation Methods

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px"> Current Research </h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:3px"> Deep Multi Magnification Network for Multi-Class Breast Cancer Tissue Segmentation</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">Currently, I am studying Multi-Encoder Multi-Decoder Multi-Concatenation network which takes image patches from  breast cancer whole side image at multi-magnification level as input and outputs the classification and segmentation of the tissue subtypes. Currently, the model can segment 6 classes of tissue subtypes. My objective is to retrain the network with publicly available datasets (CAMELYON16,17) and to include more class predictions to increase the accuracy of the pathological examination of breast cancer.</p>

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Professional Experience</h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Engineering Manager MGH Logistics Ltd. MGH Group [Jan'23 to Present]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">Starting of the year 2024, I was appointed as the engineering manager of a logistics and order management platform( <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhzC6554nGKg1rjZufO3UVJvUGfPqoj9/view?usp=sharing"><i style="color:#e74d3c">Learn More</i></a></strong>), V-SOL (A Infor Nexus Product) for MGH freight forwarding wing. Currently, I am leading the `Shipment Tracking` project for sea and air freight. I have developed a standalone microservice which pulls ship and container tracking information from the carrier's system and posts it to V-SOL through Infor ION middleware. I have followed the Domain-Driven-Design with an API gateway to connect with the carriers. The API is consumed periodically via a background/cron job. Users of the platform can now view the location of their shipment on a world map with shipment information such as the date and time of departure from the origin port, transition port arrival-departure and destination arrival. </p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:22px; text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I am working on developing an Exception Management service for V-SOL. The service will notify the buyer and LSP users from MGH in real time if any exception is taking place during the total shipment process. The exceptions rules can be set by the buyer and easily changable through an admin portal. To notify we are using Event-Bus architecture and the information will be sent by organisation messaging channels such as Microsoft Teams.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Senior Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Jan'21 to Dec'22]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At Obhai, I contributed to the system scaling to serve one million customers daily. Moreover, improved the monolithic system by creating modular and reusable functions. Furthermore, I introduced the Master-Slave architecture for database servers which improved the traffic management of the platform.</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Additionally, I was one of the core developers of the `Cashless Payment` project. I have developed the direct debit feature so that the users do not have to initiate the payment manually. The payment is deducted from the selected payment method after ending the ride automatically. To prevent unwanted cases I have added a retry mechanism for failed transactions. I have also contributed to the `Payout` project. In Obhai, drivers get their commission in real-time after completing the ride which has increased the trust and reliability of the platform. I developed the function to calculate the driver's balance and the amount to be disbursed through payout. It ensured the correctness of the transactions.</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
During that time I was involved in building an ML-based fare engine which utilises the Obhai customer profile data and provides dynamic taxi fares based on the customer's historical journey with Obhai. The service was launched in the last quarter of 2022. The service eventually increased the number of daily rides by 13%.  
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
In addition to my technical contributions, I led a backend team and regularly conducted sprint planning, code reviews, and internal technical troubleshooting. Aside from that, I took an active role in the hiring process and training the new joiners.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px;">Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Apr'19 to Dec'21]</h3> 
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">I joined Obhai right after my graduation as a backend developer. My first project was A Dynamic Commission Module of Obhai drivers. I built a tool to define commission rates for the drivers based on geo-location, service type and performance score. The method later on was adopted by other ride-sharing platforms in the market.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Aside from that, I worked on developing administrative tools and BI reports.</p>

<h4 class="h2-color" style="margin : 0">Drowsy Drivers</h4>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:12px; text-align: justify;">A Computer Vision and Deep Learning based program which detects drowsy drivers while driving. The program uses OpenCV and Dlib's facial landmark detection algorithm to detect and segment eye regions from a real-time video stream. The model can detect drowsy eyes by measuring eye aspect ratio and trigger an alarm if the eyes are kept closed for 5 seconds continuously.</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-top: 0; text-align: justify; margin-bottom:12px;">A Desktop app built on Electron and client-side database. It is a user-friendly in-house library management system which includes book stock management, and record keeping of books taken. It also includes an alert system to notify the user to return the books before the due date. The app includes 2-factor authentication and role-based access.</p>


<h4 class="h2-color" style="margin : 0">Crop Land Classification</h4>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:12px; text-align: justify;">In this project, I have utilised a conventional CNN, an Ensemble Learning Approach and Advanced Neural Network with Residual and Inception-like Models. The models are trained with cropland satellite imagery from USDA's CDL (Cropland Data Layer) and NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery from the USGS Earth Explorer of Fresno, California U.S.A. 2018). The training data set was prepared through Image Patch Extraction and Class Balancing.
