<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px;"> About Me</h2>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">I am a Research Assistant at Georgia Southern University, currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with a concentration in AI-driven healthcare systems and knowledge representation for security and privacy.
<br><br>

My research is positioned at the convergence of Healthcare AI, Knowledge Graphs, and Generative AI, where I explore how intelligent systems can bridge human understanding and machine reasoning. I am developing deep transformer-based models for clinical voice disorder analysis, aiming to empower speech pathologists with data-driven tools for precise diagnosis and longitudinal voice assessment.
<br><br>

In parallel, I contribute to GraphRagLLM, a large language model–augmented knowledge graph framework that integrates semantic graph mining with context-aware reasoning to improve the interpretability, traceability, and compliance analysis of corporate privacy and security policies
<br><br>

I bring five years of industry experience from Bangladesh, where I developed scalable, distributed transportation and logistics platforms serving millions of users in real time. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from BRAC University, where my background in competitive debating sharpened my logical thinking—an ability that now fuels both my engineering and research pursuits.

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px"> Publications </h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:3px"> GraphDPR: A Privacy Policy Analysis Framework Using Knowledge Graphs and Topic Modeling
Proceeding - 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025)</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">Privacy policies are often complex and hard for users and auditors to interpret, especially in e-commerce. Motivated by the need for better transparency and scalable compliance, we introduced GraphDPR: a graph-based framework that uses transformer models, semantic knowledge graphs (Neo4j), and topic modeling (LDA) to extract and analyze privacy policy content across multiple companies. Our approach enables interpretable audits, reveals shared and unique patterns in data collection, and aligns practices with regulatory standards. Results show GraphDPR improves regulatory coverage and topic clarity compared to PolicyGPT and Poligraph, supporting more robust privacy policy assessment and compliance benchmarking</p>

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px"> Current Research Projects </h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:3px"> GraphRag Inference for privacy Policy analysis of S\&P Companies</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">Currently, I am working on a knowledge graph-based framework infused with LLM to provide any user with an inference to ask questions and receive a formatted answer related to company-specific privacy policies.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:3px">Voice Disorder Detection and Classification Using Deep Transformer Based Models</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">The research project aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and intervention timelines by leveraging large-scale speech datasets and advanced transformer models, contributing to more accessible and intelligent speech-language pathology tools.</p>


<h2 class="h2-color"  style="margin-bottom:8px">Professional Experience</h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Engineering Manager MGH Logistics Ltd. MGH Group [Jan'23 to Dec'23]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">Starting of the year 2024, I was appointed as the engineering manager of a logistics and order management platform( <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhzC6554nGKg1rjZufO3UVJvUGfPqoj9/view?usp=sharing"><i style="color:#e74d3c">Learn More</i></a></strong>), V-SOL (A Infor Nexus Product) for MGH freight forwarding wing. Currently, I led the `Shipment Tracking` project for sea and air freight. I built a standalone microservice which pulls ship and container tracking information from the carrier's system and posts it to V-SOL through Infor ION middleware. I have followed the Domain-Driven-Design with an API gateway to connect with the carriers. The API is consumed periodically via a background/cron job. Users of the platform can now view the location of their shipment on a world map with shipment information such as the date and time of departure from the origin port, transition port arrival-departure and destination arrival. </p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:22px; text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I worked on developing an Exception Management service for MGH. The service notifies the buyer and LSP users from MGH in real time if any exception is taking place during the total shipment process. The exceptions rules can be set by the buyer and easily changable through an admin portal. To notify we are using Event-Bus architecture and the information will be sent by organisation messaging channels such as Microsoft Teams.</p>



<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:8px">Senior Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Jan'21 to Dec'22]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At Obhai, I contributed to the system scaling to serve one million customers daily. Moreover, improved the monolithic system by creating modular and reusable functions. Furthermore, I introduced the Master-Slave architecture for database servers which improved the traffic management of the platform.</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Additionally, I was one of the core developers of the `Cashless Payment` project.Developed the direct debit feature so that the users do not have to initiate the payment manually. The payment is deducted from the selected payment method after ending the ride automatically. To prevent unwanted cases I have added a retry mechanism for failed transactions. I have also contributed to the `Payout` project. In Obhai, drivers get their commission in real-time after completing the ride which has increased the trust and reliability of the platform. I developed the function to calculate the driver's balance and the amount to be disbursed through payout. It ensured the correctness of the transactions.</p>

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
During that time I was involved in building an ML-based fare engine which utilises the Obhai customer profile data and provides dynamic taxi fares based on the customer's historical journey with Obhai. The service was launched in the last quarter of 2022. The service eventually increased the number of daily rides by 13%.

<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
In addition to my technical contributions, I led a backend team and regularly conducted sprint planning, code reviews, and internal technical troubleshooting. Aside from that, I took an active role in the hiring process and training the new joiners.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color"  style="margin-bottom:8px;">Software Engineer, OBHAI Solutions Ltd. [Apr'19 to Dec'21]</h3> 
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">I joined Obhai right after my graduation as a backend developer. My first project was A Dynamic Commission Module of Obhai drivers. I built a tool to define commission rates for the drivers based on geo-location, service type and performance score. The method later on was adopted by other ride-sharing platforms in the market.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Aside from that, I worked on developing administrative tools and BI reports.</p>
